//
//  SharedMLXBridgeRegistry.swift
//  CorridorKey by LateNite
//
//  Process-wide cache of warmed `MLXKeyingEngine`s keyed by `(device,
//  rung)`. Before this registry each `InferenceCoordinator` held its own
//  `MLXKeyingEngine`, which meant a project with five clips using
//  Corridor Key paid for five copies of the same `.mlxfn` bridge in
//  memory (≈ 300 MB per copy at 1024). With the registry the bridge
//  loads once per `(device, rung)` and is shared across every plug-in
//  instance for the lifetime of the process.
//
//  The registry also enables eager warm-up from
//  `CorridorKeyToolboxPlugIn.init` — when FxPlug creates a new plug-in
//  instance we kick off a warm-up task into this registry; by the time
//  the user clicks Analyse Clip or starts playback, MLX is already
//  compiled and warm, eliminating the 2–5 s first-play stall.
//
//  Lifetime: engines are held strongly for the process's life until they
//  fall out of LRU. On Apple Silicon the underlying MLX buffers sit in
//  unified memory and are released when the engine is dropped; since FCP
//  can return to the same project repeatedly in a session, keeping
//  engines warm matches user intent. The per-device LRU cap is sized off
//  `MTLDevice.recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize` so a 16 GB Mac mini holds
//  fewer rungs than a 192 GB Mac Studio. The currently-active rung is
//  pinned and never evicted; only older, unused rungs get released.
