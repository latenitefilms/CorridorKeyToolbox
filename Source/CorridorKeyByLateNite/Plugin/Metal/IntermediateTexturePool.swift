//  IntermediateTexturePool.swift
//  CorridorKey by LateNite
//
//  Reuses Metal textures between frames instead of allocating fresh ones on
//  every render. Profiling v0 CorridorKey by LateNite renders at 3840 × 2160
//  showed ~8–12 intermediate textures allocated per frame (despill output,
//  two morphology ping-pongs, two Gaussian ping-pongs, resample targets,
//  etc.) — at 30 fps this added up to several hundred texture allocations per
//  second per plug-in instance, which shows up as command-queue kickoff
//  jitter in the Metal system trace.
//
//  Design:
//  * One pool per Metal device (owned by `MetalDeviceCacheEntry`).
//  * Textures are keyed by `(width, height, pixelFormat, usage, storageMode)`.
//    Two sites asking for the same shape and flags collapse onto the same
//    free list so they share the same physical memory over time.
//  * Acquired textures are returned via the command buffer's completion
//    handler, guaranteeing the GPU is done with them before reuse.
//  * A soft cap per-bucket keeps peak memory sane on pathological timelines
//    (e.g. compressed + uncompressed rendered side-by-side in different
//    instances).
//
//  We intentionally do **not** use `MTLHeap`. `MTLHeap` needs explicit hazard
//  tracking with `MTLFence`s when textures flip direction between command
//  buffers, and the bookkeeping complexity outweighs the win on Apple Silicon
//  where the driver aggressively recycles device-allocated textures under
//  unified memory. The benefit here comes from not calling
//  `device.makeTexture` on the render thread; the underlying memory does not
//  move whether a heap holds it or not.
